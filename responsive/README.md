# Day 1 - using percentages for widths and avoid defining heights

- Percentages vs Fixed widths  
  Always use percentage than defining fixed widths to maintain responsiveness
- Percentages on the child means the relative portion to parent component
- Why it's a good idea to avoid heights  
  This is a general rule. There are times when you want to use height, but for the most part, they cause more issues than they solve. If you really need to use height, use `min-height` instead.
